      <![CDATA[Open or Closed - Yet another Business Hours package!

Inspired by the Dexmoor BusinessHours package, this one uses the built-in date and time picker and targets Umbraco 8.6+

There are two nuGet packages:
* OpenOrClosed - DataType Definitions and Property Editors for the Umbraco Back-Office
* OpenOrClosed.Core - PropertyValueConverters for use with ModelsBuilder to provide strongly typed models.

Property Editors:

Standard Business Hours:
Monday through to Sunday and optionally Bank Holidays, set each day Open or Closed with multiple ranges of times in either 24- or 12-hour time.  Each time range can be flagged with "By Appointment".

Special Business Hours:
Adds the ability to specify specific dates, with the same set of features for Standard Business Hours.]]>
